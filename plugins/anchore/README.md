# Codefresh Anchore Plugin

Anchore is a service that analyzes Docker images and generates a detailed manifest of the image, a virtual ‘bill of materials’ that includes official operating system packages, unofficial packages, configuration files, and language modules and artifacts. Anchore policies can they be defined to govern security vulnerabilities, package whitelists and blacklists, configuration file contents, presence of credentials in image, manifest changes, exposed ports or any user defined checks. These policies can be deployed site wide or customized for specific images or categories of applications.
